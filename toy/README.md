# The beginning of the era where AI creates AI
*(AIがAIを作る時代の始まり)*

## Overview

This repository contains a **toy-level predictor**.
It works — sometimes it hits, sometimes it misses.

Why is this here? Because this is the basis.
What it supports is not written here. You will find it in the next stage.

**File name says everything: Frame Problem Solved.**

---

## Usage

```bash
python toy_predictor.py sample.csv
```

- **Input**: `sample.csv` (toy price data).
- **Output**: Logs in ADA Monitor style, e.g.

```
[ALERT] Hit BTC 📈 +0.45% price=1632450.00 note=toy-hit
[ALERT] Follow:union BTC 📉 -0.22% price=1632000.00 note=toy-follow
```

This is toy-level demonstration only, **not production**.

---

## Notes

- Academic style, minimal explanation.
- All parameters are fixed inside `toy_predictor.py`.
- Results are nondeterministic but reproducible.
