### Notes on Tuning
Breaking the frame problem is not only about “working once”.
It also means you must face the tedious reality of *fine-grained adjustment*.
Annoying? Yes.
But that is exactly the proof it is real.

Once you cross the frame problem, the world does not become easier.
It becomes tunable, endlessly so.
